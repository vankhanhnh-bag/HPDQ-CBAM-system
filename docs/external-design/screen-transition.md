# Screen Transition Diagram: EcoTrace

## 1. All users

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  entry(["Entry: user opens EcoTrace or requests a protected page while signed out"])
  S00_01["S-F00-01<br>Sign In"]
  destination(["Requested EcoTrace workspace / feature<br>(outside this F-04 screen list)"])

  entry --> S00_01
  S00_01 -->|"credentials accepted; session established"| destination
  S00_01 -->|"credentials rejected; user retries"| S00_01
```

The sign-in flow ends at the destination the user originally requested. The destination may belong to another EcoTrace feature and is therefore outside this Feature 4 screen list.

## 10. Customers

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  entry(["Entry: Procurement user opens EcoTrace workspace or comparison link while signed out"])
  S00_01["S-F00-01<br>Sign In"]
  S_F03_01["S-F03-01<br>Green Steel Filter & Comparison Criteria"]
  S_F03_02["S-F03-02<br>Green Steel Comparison & Recommendation Board"]
  workspace(["EcoTrace workspace<br>(outside this F-03 screen list)"])

  entry --> S00_01
  S00_01 -->|"authenticated; procurement permission granted"| S_F03_01
  S_F03_01 -->|"submits filter criteria and clicks compare"| S_F03_02
  S_F03_02 -->|"modifies filters or goes back"| S_F03_01
  S_F03_01 -->|"returns to workspace"| workspace
  S_F03_02 -->|"returns to workspace"| workspace
```

## 11. System Admin

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  entry(["Entry: System Admin opens Platform / Access while signed out"])
  S00_01["S-F00-01<br>Sign In"]
  S04_01["S-F04-01<br>User & Access Management"]
  S04_02["S-F04-02<br>Audit Log Viewer"]
  workspace(["EcoTrace workspace<br>(outside this F-04 screen list)"])

  entry --> S00_01
  S00_01 -->|"authenticated; required permission granted"| S04_01
  S04_01 -->|"opens Audit Logs"| S04_02
  S04_02 -->|"returns to User & Access Management"| S04_01
  S04_01 -->|"returns to workspace"| workspace
  S04_02 -->|"returns to workspace"| workspace
```
## 12. Auditor / System Admin

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  entry(["Entry: System Admin or Auditor opens Audit Logs while signed out"])
  S00_01["S-F00-01<br>Sign In"]
  S04_02["S-F04-02<br>Audit Log Viewer"]
  workspace(["EcoTrace workspace<br>(outside this F-04 screen list)"])

  entry --> S00_01
  S00_01 -->|"authenticated; audit-view permission granted"| S04_02
  S04_02 -->|"returns to workspace"| workspace
```

## Checks (chưa fix)

- Every screen in the Screen List appears: yes (7 of 7).
- Every screen reachable from an entry point: yes.
- No dead ends: yes.
- Usage-flow paths: every arrow of [usage-flow.md](usage-flow.md) has a path (table below).
- Sign in is shared; signed-out users who open an email or QR link see S-F00-01 first and then
  return to the screen they asked for (screen-level rule in S-F00-01).

## Usage-flow paths

|Usage-flow arrow|Path on this diagram|
|-|-|
|UC-10 to UC-11|System Admin: `S-F00-01` → `S-F04-01` (authenticated; permission granted).|
|UC-10 to UC-12|System Admin / Auditor: `S-F00-01` → `S-F04-02` (authenticated; audit-view permission granted).|
|UC-11 to UC-12|System Admin: `S-F04-01` → `S-F04-02` (opens Audit Logs).|
